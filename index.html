            <p>Born in Sammamish Washington in 2004, I grew up in a time where technology was evolving. I can say I lived in a time where we used CDs, MP3 players, and about 20 years later things like artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and cryptocurrency. I have always been fascinated with technology, ever since my first ipod touch. I knew I wanted a career in tech ever since I took my favorite interest which was playing video games, and learned how they were made. Complex algorithms of zeroes and ones, and each lesson I learned introduced me to more and more vast branches of technology to be learned. Technology is integrated in almost every part of daily life now, and it is not stopping. With the recent development of large scale quantum computing and exponential usability of AI, the ceiling for how much technology can help is second to none. Working in software solutions is where I belong and what I find joy in. Software, internet, and computer systems are like big legos in all different shapes sizes and pixels. I am passionate about building, editing, and debugging these puzzle like infrastructures and am constantly developing my skills as a programmer. My strongest programming language is C/C#/C++ due to my game development programming and general project experience, but I am proficient in Java/JavaScript, python, HTML/CSS, and have dabbled in Kotlin, Verilog, and PHP. I am excited to see what I learn next and where I find myself in my future career.</p>

            <p>The first project is a wrapper of nmap (network mapper) named gmap that one can use as a full-force network mapper. Gmap takes the golden-standard usability nmap has to offer and provides the maximum functionality nmap has to offer, scanning all ports regardless of routing status, returning operating system information and versions. Built in 1997, nmap was ran on a fraction of the computing power we have today. Instead of scanning the usual 100 or 1000 ports nmap scans for resource management, the CLI flags gmap has in the pythons script scan all 65,535 ports and returns all information nmap has to offer from 7 different flags, in one command reducing need for memorization and introducing simplicity. </p>

            <p>The second project is a euclidian horror game made in Unity as a final project for class SE186 at Iowa State University. This game is based on the concept of a dormitory with labyrinth like properties, and incorporates several core principles learned in the course, such as algorithmic design, 3D game mechanics, and real-time graphics rendering. The project involved a combination of coding in C# and using Unityâ€™s built-in tools to create a fully functional game that includes immersive horror elements and engaging gameplay. Whats special about Friley Frights is that the map changes behind you, rearranging rooms in real-time with raycasting and integer math. Referenced in video is my contribution to the project mainly in map design, this 3d map of a dormitory was done by myself in my git branch, this is a virtual demonstration of the prefabricated room modules for the map. </p>

            The third project is a safety demonstration for chainsaws in order to educate one before using a chainsaw in order to prevent workplace accidents. The program is a 3d interactive model of a chainsaw with every part of a standard chainsaw labeled for one to see and take note of, along with demonstrating how to turn it on safely, and make sure it continues to work. A chainsaw is not so straight forward, and it is detrimental that the operator knows the workings of a chainsaw in order to work efficiently. Note: The program is in it's early stages and there are more demonstration features to be implemented.
