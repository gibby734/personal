            <p>Born in Sammamish, Washington in 2004, I’ve always been fascinated by technology, from my first iPod Touch to modern AI, cloud computing, and cryptocurrency. My interest in video games led me to explore how software is built, and I enjoy designing, editing, and debugging complex systems. My strongest programming languages are C, C#, and C++, and I’m also proficient in Java, JavaScript, Python, and HTML/CSS, with some experience in Kotlin, Verilog, and PHP. I’m excited to keep learning and see where my career in tech takes me.</p>

                    <p>Homework Reminder is a chrome extension that I created to boost productivity and help aid forgetfulness with a focus for school assignments. Homework reminder is a helpful tool that allows users to create a reminder with a title, date, and time. If one has an assignment due at 11:59, Homework Reminder can play a distinct mp3 sound to alert the user whenever the user deems convenient. On another hand, if a user wants to recess for 30 minutes, they can open Homework Reminder (it opens on the current date and time) and scroll 30 minutes in advance, then they will be reminded.</p>

                    <p>Password Protect is a Chrome extension designed to enhance online security and productivity by allowing users to lock access to specific websites with a simple password. Users can easily add any website URL to the extension's popup interface, and once added, that site will be protected with a password prompt every time it's accessed. This extension is perfect for preventing procrastination on social media sites, protecting sensitive work sites from unauthorized access, or creating parental controls. The clean and intuitive interface makes it easy to add or remove protected sites, and the password system ensures that only authorized users can access locked content. Built with JavaScript and Chrome's extension APIs, it provides seamless integration with the browser experience.</p>

                    <p>Gmap is a wrapper of nmap (network mapper) named with my first initial that one can use as a full-force network mapper. Gmap takes the golden-standard usability nmap has to offer and provides the maximum functionality nmap has to offer, scanning all ports regardless of routing status, returning operating system information and versions. Built in 1997, nmap was ran on a fraction of the computing power we have today. Instead of scanning the usual 100 or 1000 ports nmap scans for resource management, the CLI flags gmap has in the pythons script scan all 65,535 ports and returns all information nmap has to offer from 7 different flags, in one command reducing need for memorization and introducing simplicity.</p>

                    <p>Friley Frights is a euclidian horror game made in Unity as a final project for class SE186 at Iowa State University. This game is based on the concept of a dormitory with labyrinth like properties, and incorporates several core principles learned in the course, such as algorithmic design, 3D game mechanics, and real-time graphics rendering. The project involved a combination of coding in C# and using Unity's built-in tools to create a fully functional game that includes immersive horror elements and engaging gameplay. What's special about Friley Frights is that the map changes behind you, rearranging rooms in real-time with raycasting and integer math. Referenced in video is my contribution to the project mainly in map design, this 3d map of a dormitory was done by myself in my git branch, this is a virtual demonstration of the prefabricated room modules for the map.</p>

                    <p>This chainsaw demonstration executable is a safety demonstration for modern chainsaws in order to educate one before using a chainsaw in order to prevent workplace accidents. The program is a 3d interactive model of a chainsaw with every part of a standard chainsaw labeled for one to see and take note of, along with demonstrating how to turn it on safely, and make sure it continues to work. A chainsaw is not so straight forward, and it is detrimental that the operator knows the workings of a chainsaw in order to work efficiently. Note: The program is in its early stages and there are more demonstration features to be implemented.</p>
