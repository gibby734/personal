            <p>As an undergraduate student at Iowa State University majoring in Software Engineering with a minor in Cybersecurity, I am passionate about developing robust and secure software solutions. My academic journey has equipped me with a strong foundation in coding languages such as HTML, CSS, C, C#, Python, and Java, and I am proficient in working on both Linux and Windows platforms. I am eager to further hone my skills through internship opportunities in a collaborative, team-oriented development environment. My goal is to contribute to innovative projects while gaining practical experience and expanding my technical expertise. I am particularly interested in roles that challenge me to apply my knowledge in real-world scenarios and foster my growth as a software engineer.</p>

            <p>The first project is a spinoff of nmap (network mapper) named gmap that one can use as a one-stop-shop network mapper. gmap takes the golden-standard usability nmap has to offer and provides the maximum functionality nmap has to offer. Built in 1997, nmap was ran on a fraction of the computing power we have today. Instead of scanning the usual 100 or 1000 ports nmap scans for resource management, the CLI flags gmap has in the pythons script scan all 65,535 ports and returns all information nmap has to offer from 7 different flags, in one command reducing need for memorization and introducing simplicity. </p>

            <p>The second project is a Euclydian horror game made in Unity as a final project for class SE186 at Iowa State University. This game is based on the concept of Euclidean geometry and incorporates several core principles learned in the course, such as algorithmic design, 3D game mechanics, and real-time graphics rendering. The project involved a combination of coding in C# and using Unityâ€™s built-in tools to create a fully functional game that includes immersive horror elements and engaging gameplay. Referenced in video is my contribution to the project mainly in map design, this 3d map of a dormitory was done by myself and in its early stages this is a git-commit of a rough draft for the map. The improvements made past this rough draft were: integer prefab snapping so the floor tiles were seamless, random map generation so rooms would change periodically, a dining hall prefab, and audio mechanics such as music and footstep noise. </p>
