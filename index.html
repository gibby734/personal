            <p>As an undergraduate student at Iowa State University majoring in Software Engineering with a minor in Cybersecurity, I am passionate about developing robust and secure software solutions. My academic journey has equipped me with a strong foundation in coding languages such as HTML, CSS, C, C#, Python, and Java, and I am proficient in working on both Linux and Windows platforms. I am eager to further hone my skills through internship opportunities in a collaborative, team-oriented development environment. My goal is to contribute to innovative projects while gaining practical experience and expanding my technical expertise. I am particularly interested in roles that challenge me to apply my knowledge in real-world scenarios and foster my growth as a software engineer.</p>

            <p>The first project is a wrapper of nmap (network mapper) named gmap that one can use as a full-force network mapper. Gmap takes the golden-standard usability nmap has to offer and provides the maximum functionality nmap has to offer, scanning all ports regardless of routing status, returning operating system information and versions. Built in 1997, nmap was ran on a fraction of the computing power we have today. Instead of scanning the usual 100 or 1000 ports nmap scans for resource management, the CLI flags gmap has in the pythons script scan all 65,535 ports and returns all information nmap has to offer from 7 different flags, in one command reducing need for memorization and introducing simplicity. </p>

            <p>The second project is a euclidian horror game made in Unity as a final project for class SE186 at Iowa State University. This game is based on the concept of a dormitory with labyrinth like properties, and incorporates several core principles learned in the course, such as algorithmic design, 3D game mechanics, and real-time graphics rendering. The project involved a combination of coding in C# and using Unityâ€™s built-in tools to create a fully functional game that includes immersive horror elements and engaging gameplay. Whats special about Friley Frights is that the map changes behind you, rearranging rooms in real-time with raycasting and integer math. Referenced in video is my contribution to the project mainly in map design, this 3d map of a dormitory was done by myself in my git branch, this is a virtual demonstration of the prefabricated room modules for the map. </p>

            The third project is a safety demonstration for chainsaws in order to educate one before using a chainsaw in order to prevent workplace accidents. The program is a 3d interactive model of a chainsaw with every part of a standard chainsaw labeled for one to see and take note of, along with demonstrating how to turn it on safely, and make sure it continues to work. A chainsaw is not so straight forward, and it is detrimental that the operator knows the workings of a chainsaw in order to work efficiently. Note: The program is in it's early stages and there are more demonstration features to be implemented.
