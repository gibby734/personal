           <p> As an undergraduate student at Iowa State University majoring in Software Engineering <br>
         with a minor in Cybersecurity, I am passionate about developing robust and secure software <br>
          solutions. My academic journey has equipped me with a strong foundation in coding languages <br>
           such as HTML, CSS, C, C#, Python, and Java, and I am proficient in working on both Linux and <br>
           Windows platforms. I am eager to further hone my skills through internship opportunities in a <br>
             collaborative, team-oriented development environment. My goal is to contribute to innovative <br>
              projects while gaining practical experience and expanding my technical expertise. <br>
               I am particularly interested in roles that challenge me to apply my knowledge in real-world <br>
                scenarios and foster my growth as a software engineer. <br></p>

            <h3>Project 1</h3>
            <p>The first project is related to develop a single Web page using
            only two technologies: HTML and CSS. The project consists in
            creating a single web page with a menu at the top know as
            Navigation Bar. We have to include text describing ourself and
            text describing the project. Additionally, we need to include
            two images: one image is of ourself and second image is anything
            related to the project itself.</p>
